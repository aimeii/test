      <p>Verizon Connect aims to guide a connected world by automating, optimizing and revolutionizing the way people, vehicles, and things move through the world. The solutions that Verizon Connect offers revolve around better fleet management which  includes compliance to government rules and regulations, reduced fuel use, increased productivity, and safer driving.
      </p>

      <p>During my virtual internship, I was able to work on both enterprise products like Reveal and consumer products like Hum.
      </p>

      <p>Reveal allows fleet managers to streamline and automate compliance to follow regulations made by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) (ex. <a href="https://www.verizonconnect.com/solutions/eld-compliance-management-software/eld-mandate/" target="_blank"> ELD Mandate</a>, <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/regulations/hours-of-service" target="_blank"> Updated Hours of Service Rules</a>). This includes solutions such as Logbook and the Electronic Logging Device (ELD) which tracks a driver’s hours of service (HOS) ensuring that drivers adhere to the legal limits. During my time at Verizon, I also worked on their new electronic driver vehicle inspection report that allows commercial drivers to complete their mandatory pre and post trip inspections digitally.
      </p>

      <p>Hum is Verizon Connect’s consumer product that is designed to help users have a smarter, safer, and more connected driving experience. Hum connects to a user's car in order to diagnose vehicle problems, provide access to roadside assistance and emergency help, and monitor a vehicle's health and location.

      <h3 id="context"> What I did</h3>

      <p>My bandwidth during this internship was divided between two areas of research. The first being product and user insights. I was responsible for conducting user research for the integration and addition of new features to Reveal as well as gathering feedback from our users about their user journey. The second part of my research related to the Experience Team’s internal research repository and how research is shared amongst researchers, designers, engineers, and product managers.
      <br><br>
      </p>

      <h3 id="context"> My Process</h3>
      <p><strong>Compliance Related User Research:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Created surveys to send to designated customer lists</li>
      <li>
        Conducted user interviews with fleet managers to inform user journey</li>
      <li>
        Participated in stakeholder meetings to understand company goals</li>
      <li>
        Ensured products aligned with user needs, company goals, and updated regulatory standards by the FMCSA</li>
      <li>
        Researched user needs beyond compliance by performing a deep dive on long haul truck drivers</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Research Coordination and Repository Design</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Assessed the current state of the research repository and other research management/sharing tools (Google Drive, Confluence, Research Documents, Monday.com)</li>
      <li>
        Met with researchers to ensure understanding of research needs for each project</li>
      <li>
        Organized the research repository taking product, engineering, and marketing considerations into account</li>
      <li>
        Digitized the research repository into a searchable database</li>
      <li>
        Created a standardized heuristic evaluation with <a href="https://www.oklawson.com/" target="_blank"> Olivia Lawson</a> which we used to evaluate Verizon Connect’s consumer product Hum</li>
<br>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="context"> Impact and Results</h3>
      <p><strong>Internally:</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Optimized research processes resulted in reduced time and cost to recruit, and less time for our stakeholders to search through previous research
      </li>
      <li>
        Standardized formats within User Interviews platform for recruitment and setting up projects
      </li>
      <li>
        Recommendations on how to start design testing through a Heuristic Evaluation
      </li>
      <li>
        Recommendations and initial designs for digitizing and using the research repository.
      </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Product</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Navigated the integration of EDVIR and ELD into one complete product and experience
      </li>
      <li>
        Strong insights on value propositions for products including Reveal and Hum
      </li>
      <li>
        Recommendations for the product team to consider for compliance roadmaps
      </li>
      <li>
        Shift focus to create products with truckers health needs and daily routines in mind
      </li>
      <br>
      </ul>
